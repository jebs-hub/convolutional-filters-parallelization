# Convolutional ilters parallelization
This project's goal is to code convolutional filters algorithms to be executed in a GPU, using CUDA and Bend. 

## Installing Bend

Follow this [link](https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/getting-started/installation.html) to install Rust and Cargo. 

Follow this [link](https://github.com/HigherOrderCO/Bend) to install and start with Bend.

## Execute code

Run `test.sh` inside the `src` folder. It will compile C programs and execute all versions of blur filter (only implemented so far).

The output images will be save in a separate folder. You can check the result there.
